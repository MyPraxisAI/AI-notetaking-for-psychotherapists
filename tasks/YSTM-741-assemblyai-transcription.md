# YSTM-741: Add AssemblyAI Transcription Engine Support

## Context
Currently, the audio transcription processor only supports Yandex SpeechKit V3 (Russian) as the transcription engine. To improve flexibility and accuracy, we want to add support for AssemblyAI as an alternative transcription engine. This will allow us to leverage AssemblyAI's advanced transcription features and support for additional languages.

## Requirements
- Add support for AssemblyAI as a selectable transcription engine in the audio transcription processor.
- Update the `recordings` table and processing logic to allow specifying `assemblyai` as the `transcription_engine`.
- Implement the integration with AssemblyAI's API for audio transcription.
- Ensure the processor can select the correct engine based on the `transcription_engine` field in the recording metadata.
- Store the resulting transcript in the same way as existing engines.
- Add error handling and logging for AssemblyAI integration.
- Update documentation and code comments as needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The audio transcription processor can use AssemblyAI for transcription when specified.
- [x] The `transcription_engine` field in the `recordings` table can be set correctly.
- [x] Transcripts generated by AssemblyAI are stored in the `transcripts` table with the correct model name.
- [x] Errors from AssemblyAI are logged and handled gracefully.
- [x] The codebase is updated with clear documentation for the new engine.
- [x ] Existing Yandex functionality is not affected. 

## TODO

[x] Add ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY to ParameterStore
[x] Delete the transcript from Assembly right after fetching it
[x] Verify right selection engine is used when none passed from UI (also for non-SuperAdmin)
